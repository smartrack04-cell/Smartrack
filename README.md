This project aims to develop an intelligent railway seat status monitoring and booking system powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to enhance passenger convenience, optimize seat allocation, and reduce manual workload. The system integrates real-time train seat availability detection, predictive seat occupancy analysis, and automated booking recommendations.

Using historical passenger booking patterns, seasonal travel trends, and real-time data from railway databases or IoT-enabled sensors, the ML model predicts seat demand, identifies probable cancellations, and recommends alternative travel options for passengers. AI algorithms dynamically update seat status, ensuring accurate availability display to users.

Passengers can check live seat status, receive AI-driven booking suggestions (such as optimal train selection, seat preference matching, or cost-effective travel timings), and complete reservations through an intuitive web or mobile interface. Railway authorities can use the analytics dashboard for demand forecasting, dynamic pricing strategies, and capacityÂ planning.
